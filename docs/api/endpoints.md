# API Endpoints

Base URL (production): `https://api2.ugaktp.com`  
Base URL (internal): `http://10.0.0.53:4000`

All protected routes require `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`.

---

## Users

### `POST /users/sync`

**Auth required.** Called automatically on every login by the website (`auth.ts`). Creates or updates the user's row in the database and returns their `profile_complete` status.

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "authentik_id": "uuid",
  "username": "jsmith",
  "member_group": "active"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "authentik_id": "uuid",
  "profile_complete": false
}
```

The `member_group` is determined by group priority: `eboard > chair > active > pledge > alumni`.

---

### `GET /users/me`

**Auth required.** Returns the full profile row for the authenticated user.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "authentik_id": "uuid",
  "username": "jsmith",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Smith",
  "preferred_name": "John",
  "dob": "2003-01-15",
  "major": "Computer Science",
  "graduation_date": "Spring 2026",
  "phone": "4045550000",
  "email": "jsmith@uga.edu",
  "linkedin_url": "https://linkedin.com/in/jsmith",
  "pledge_class": "Alpha",
  "member_group": "active",
  "profile_complete": true,
  "created_at": "...",
  "updated_at": "..."
}
```

---

### `PUT /users/me/profile`

**Auth required.** Saves profile fields and sets `profile_complete = true`. Accepts `multipart/form-data`.

**Form fields:**
- `first_name`, `last_name`, `preferred_name`
- `dob` — date of birth
- `major`
- `graduation_date` — string like "Spring 2026" (the form combines semester + year before sending)
- `phone`
- `email`
- `linkedin_url`
- `pledge_class`

**Response:**
```json
{ "profile_complete": true }
```

After a successful response, the website calls `update({ profile_complete: true })` to update the NextAuth session without a round-trip.

---

### `PUT /users/me/profile-picture`

**Auth required.** Multipart upload, field name `file`. Images only (JPEG/PNG/WebP), 10MB limit — a separate, stricter multer config than the general photo uploader. Uploads to Immich and saves the returned asset id onto the user's row.

---

### `GET /users/:id/profile-picture/media`

**Auth required.** Streams a member's profile picture from Immich (forwards `Range` headers). Generalized to **any** user id, not just "me" — needed so the directory, admin panel, and message threads can show other members' pictures too. 404s if the member has no picture set (the frontend's `AvatarImage` falls back to initials on a 404, no special-casing needed).

---

## Members

### `GET /members`

**Auth required.** Returns a list of members. Supports optional `?group=` query param to filter by `member_group`.

**Query params:**
- `group` — one of `active`, `pledge`, `eboard`, `chair`, `alumni`

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "authentik_id": "uuid",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Smith",
    "member_group": "active",
    "graduation_date": "Spring 2026",
    ...
  }
]
```

---

### `GET /members/:id`

**Auth required.** Returns a single member by `authentik_id`.

---

## Events

No auth required on any events route.

### `GET /events`

Returns all events.

### `POST /events`

Creates a new event.

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "title": "General Meeting",
  "description": "Weekly chapter meeting",
  "date": "2026-02-01T18:00:00Z",
  "location": "Boyd GSRC"
}
```

### `PUT /events/:id`

Updates an event by ID.

### `DELETE /events/:id`

Deletes an event by ID.

---

## Photos & Albums

Members-only — the general shared album and eboard-created named albums alike. Public photos live in the separate **Homepage Photos** section below, not here. All routes require auth + membership in one of `active`/`chair`/`alumni`/`eboard`/`pledge`.

### `GET /photos?album_id=<id>`

Returns photos in the given album. Omit `album_id` for the general "Shared Album."

### `POST /photos`

Multipart upload, field `file` (images or video, 250MB limit). Optional form fields: `album_id` (puts it in a named album instead of the general shared album), `title`, `caption`.

### `GET /photos/:id/media`

Streams the photo/video from Immich (forwards `Range` headers for video seeking).

### `DELETE /photos/:id`

The uploader can always delete their own photo. An eboard member can additionally delete any photo inside an album **they personally created** (moderation — not blanket access to every album).

---

### `GET /albums`

Lists eboard-created named albums (e.g. "Spring Retreat 2026"). Any shared-album-group member can view.

### `POST /albums`

**Eboard only.** `{ "name": "...", "description": "..." }`

---

## Homepage Photos

The **public** chapter gallery — no auth on reads, anyone can view. Writes are eboard-only. Entirely separate from the member `photos` system above (different audience, different permission model).

### `GET /homepage-photos`

Public. Returns the gallery, ordered by `display_order`.

### `POST /homepage-photos`

**Eboard only.** Multipart upload, field `file`, plus `title`/`caption`.

### `POST /homepage-photos/register`

**Eboard only.** For when someone (e.g. SWE committee) already uploaded straight into the Immich UI — registers an existing asset by id instead of uploading a new one. `{ "immich_asset_id": "...", "media_type": "image", "title": "...", "caption": "..." }`. Validates the asset actually exists in Immich before saving (a typo'd id here previously caused repeated errors on view).

### `GET /homepage-photos/:id/media`

Public. Streams the photo/video.

### `PUT /homepage-photos/reorder`

**Eboard only.** `{ "ids": [3, 1, 2] }` — sets `display_order` to match array position.

### `DELETE /homepage-photos/:id`

**Eboard only.** Only unlists the photo from the gallery — does **not** delete the underlying Immich asset, since a registered asset might be reused elsewhere.

---

## Documents

An eboard-managed file library (bylaws, meeting minutes, course files) shown in the Files & Photos portal tab. Not Immich — arbitrary file types stored on ktp-api's own disk. View: any shared-album-group member. Writes: eboard only.

### `GET /documents/folders?parent_id=<id>`

Lists subfolders of `parent_id` (omit for the top level).

### `POST /documents/folders`

**Eboard only.** `{ "name": "...", "parent_id": null }` — folders nest to any depth.

### `DELETE /documents/folders/:id`

**Eboard only.** Cascades subfolders and document rows in the DB, and also walks a recursive query to delete every nested file from disk (disk space on this server is limited — DB cascade alone would leave orphaned files).

### `GET /documents?folder_id=<id>`

Lists documents in `folder_id` (omit for the top level).

### `POST /documents`

**Eboard only.** Multipart upload, field `file` (any file type, 50MB limit), form field `folder_id` (omit for the top level).

### `GET /documents/:id/download`

Streams the file with `Content-Disposition: attachment` and the original filename.

### `GET /documents/:id/preview`

Same file, but `Content-Disposition: inline` — used for the in-portal preview (images render inline, PDFs in an `<iframe>`) instead of forcing a download.

### `DELETE /documents/:id`

**Eboard only.** Removes the DB row and unlinks the file from disk.

---

## Announcements

Eboard-only broadcast — one-way, no replies. Any shared-album-group member can view (filtered by audience).

### `GET /announcements`

Returns announcements visible to the caller: `audience IS NULL` (everyone) or `audience` matches one of the caller's Authentik groups.

### `POST /announcements`

**Eboard only.** `{ "title": "...", "body": "...", "audience": "active" }` — omit/null `audience` to send to everyone.

### `DELETE /announcements/:id`

**Eboard only.**

---

## Messages (Direct Messages)

Any member can message any other member — no membership list, unlike Group Chats below.

### `GET /messages/conversations`

Returns one entry per person the caller has exchanged messages with: their basic info, the last message, and an unread count — sorted by most recent activity.

### `GET /messages/conversations/:userId`

Full thread with that specific user, chronological.

### `POST /messages`

`{ "recipient_id": "uuid", "body": "..." }`

### `PUT /messages/conversations/:userId/read`

Marks every message from `:userId` to the caller as read.

---

## Group Chats

Eboard-created, named, with an assigned member list — access is gated by actual DB membership (`group_chat_members`), not a broad Authentik group, so most routes below check membership inline and return **403** if the caller isn't in that specific chat.

### `GET /group-chats`

Chats the caller is a member of, with last message + unread count.

### `POST /group-chats`

**Eboard only.** `{ "name": "...", "member_ids": ["uuid", "uuid"] }` — the creator is automatically added too, so eboard isn't locked out of a chat they just made.

### `DELETE /group-chats/:id`

**Eboard only.** Cascades members, messages, and read markers.

### `GET /group-chats/:id/messages`

Full thread — **403** if the caller isn't a member of this chat.

### `POST /group-chats/:id/messages`

`{ "body": "..." }` — **403** if not a member.

### `PUT /group-chats/:id/read`

Marks the chat read for the caller.

### `GET /group-chats/:id/members`

Any current member can view the participant list.

### `POST /group-chats/:id/members`

**Eboard only.** `{ "user_id": "uuid" }`

### `DELETE /group-chats/:id/members/:userId`

**Eboard only.**

---

## Admin

### `GET /admin/users`

**Auth required — eboard only.** Returns all users in the database.

Middleware verifies that `req.user.groups` contains `"eboard"`. Returns 403 otherwise.

---

## Webhooks

### `POST /webhooks/authentik`

Called by Authentik's notification transport when a user is deleted.

**Headers:**
```
X-Authentik-Token: <WEBHOOK_SECRET>
```

**Request body (Authentik format):**
```json
{
  "action": "model_deleted",
  "model": {
    "model_name": "user",
    "pk": 42
  }
}
```

> **Current status:** The `X-Authentik-Token` header is not being sent by Authentik's transport (known issue — investigated, not resolved). Workaround: manually delete rows from the `users` table when a user is removed from Authentik.
>
> ```sql
> DELETE FROM users WHERE username = 'jsmith';
> ```
